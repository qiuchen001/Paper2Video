\section{Conclusions}
\vspace{-0.4\baselineskip} 
This work tackles the long-standing bottleneck of presentation video generation by agent automation. 
With \bench, we provide the first comprehensive benchmark and well-designed metrics to rigorously evaluate presentation videos in terms of quality, knowledge coverage, and academic memorability. 
Our proposed \agent~framework demonstrates that automated generation of ready-to-use academic presentation videos is both feasible and effective, producing outputs that closely approximate author-recorded presentations while significantly reducing production time by 6 times. 
We hope our work advances AI for Research and supports scalable scholarly communication.
